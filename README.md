# Description & Context

**AERO96014 - Fundamentals of Computational Fluid Dynamics**

This respository contains 2 sets of files (for now) written in C++ & MATLAB fulfilling the Imperial Aeronautics module.

**CFD Coursework 1** (90%)

The objective of this assignment is the implementation of Thomas algorithm & Steepest Descent Iterative method to solve the Helmholtz Equation.

Files:
1. Jo Wayne Tan CFD Coursework 1.pdf - Final Report
2. ThomasAlgo&SteepestDescent.cpp - Numerical solution developed with Thomas algorithm and Steepest descent iterative method using BLAS routines
3. PlotCFD.mlx - Live script to generate plots required using data obtained in File 4.
4. Output.txt - Output file of File 2.

=================================================  

**CFD Coursework 2** 

The objective of this assignment is the development of a computer code and the assessment of its results for the solution to the 1D Euler equations using the Steger and Warming (1981) Flux Vector Splitting method. The method will be applied to the solution of the Riemann shock tube problem.

Files:  
1. Jo Wayne Tan CFD Coursework 2.pdf - Final Report  
2. StegerandWarming.m - Numerical solution developed using Flux Vector Splitting method for multiple grid sizes  
3. PlotCFD2.mlx - Live script to generate plots required using data obtained  
4. shock_analytic.dat - Output file of File 5.  
5. Shock_tube_analytic.m - Analytical solution to the Riemann shock tube problem written by Dr George Papadakis  

File 2. will produce 5 different txt documents and together with File 4. are required to run File 3. Make sure data and scripts are in the same directory.
