The objective of this assignment is the implementation of Thomas algorithm & Steepest Descent Iterative method to solve the Helmholtz Equation.

Files:

**CFD Coursework 2** 

The objective of this assignment is the development of a computer code and the assessment of its results for the solution to the 1D Euler equations using the Steger and Warming (1981) Flux Vector Splitting method. The method will be applied to the solution of the Riemann shock tube problem.

Files:  
1. Jo Wayne Tan CFD Coursework 2.pdf - Final report  
2. StegerandWarming.m - Numerical solution developed following the Flux Vector Splitting method for multiple grid sizes  
3. PlotCFD2.mlx - Live script to generate plots required using data obtained  
4. shock_analytic.dat - Output file of 5.  
5. Shock_tube_analytic.m - Analytical solution to the Riemann shock tube problem written by Dr George Papadakis  

File 2. will produce 5 different txt documents and together with File 4. are required to run File 3. Make sure data and scripts are in the same directory.
